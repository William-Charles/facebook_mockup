1. Everyone
2. Finding social content that is important to them
3. Yes, it updates with content by people that you regularly view and comment
4. All Helvetica all the time
5. The font is very hip but not distracting which makes the site feel modern but does not detract from the main goal of the user
6. Things are aligned appropriately eyes are drawn to main content first and foremost with the other content being nicely pushed back visually 
7. I think facebook might have achieved perfect main page visual and ux design
